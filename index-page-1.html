                        My name is Theodore "Sparky" Shore. I graduated from the University of Rochester in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Audio and Music Engineering. Coding is my passion, and I love finding new ways to integrate programming into the things I do, whether to make someone's life easier, show off my skills, practice new techniques, enhance my experience of my other hobbies, or just have some fun. I am a die-hard Mets and Islanders fan and a huge sports geek. I play chess, I read sheet music, I have perfect pitch, and I love to be creative. I've <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0ixEWSCGMWskM4j5pAceFkOAL3AqlAQd">written poetry</a>, I've <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdtlTDDX_FY">sung a cappella</a>, and I've traveled all over the world. I've packed a lot into my life so far, and I look forward to seeing what comes next.

                <h2 class="right">How I Fell in Love with Programming</h2>
                    <p class="three">I started college with some vague plan of what I wanted to study, but without really knowing what I wanted to do with my life. That started to change in my sophomore year when I took Intro to Audio and Music Engineering, sparking an interest in that built on my love of math, science, and music, and which morphed into a love of coding when I took Intro to C/C++ that spring. I quickly discovered how much I could do with code, and how much I enjoyed finding different solutions to a problem. Through my major, I combined coding with <a href="https://github.com/spark2212/random-music-generator" title="Random music generator GitHub repository">music</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spark2212/delayed-stratification" title="DelayStratification audio plugin GitHub repository">audio</a>. Inspired by my hobbies, I developed my skills in C++ to make a <a href="https://github.com/spark2212/cpp-chess-program.git" title="Chess program GitHub repository">chess program</a>, and eventually, I taught myself Python, researched machine learning and developed a <a href="https://youtu.be/CI8g86eFOIQ" title="Goal horn demo video">voice-activated NHL goal horn program</a>. I discovered a tool, a talent, and a hidden love that spring, and to this day I enjoy finding ways to meet my goals through code.</p>

                            Throughout my life, I have been exposed to and taken up many interests in life. Some of them were temporary: drawing, piano. Some have been lifelong: chess, astronomy, math, mythology, music. My most deeply-rooted recreational passion, for lack of a better term, is about seven years old now.

                            I fell in love with baseball during the Mets' 2015 run to the World Series, and I haven't looked back. I fell in love with the Islanders in early 2019, and over time became a huge fan of sports in general. Even though I grew up in Los Angeles, I became a Mets and Islanders fan not because they happened to be good when I started paying attention, but because my dad came from New York, has always rooted for New York teams, and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ej-JtMdTVSY" title="Why I Became a Mets Fan">I have many rather loud but positive memories associated with those teams as a result</a>. As I have gotten older, I have gotten more involved with my fandom, joining Facebook fan groups, attending games, developing my goal horn program, and even spending four hours on a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid022Ro2jt2sJtvHFpTwJSVjjmwKa4BDLyZkm4iWZRfzqrFtna4VxviMEWPaf77b8qNal&id=100012885035534" title="Islanders logo whiteboard drawing Facebook post">full-color whiteboard drawing of the New York Islanders logo</a> outside of my dorm room in late 2019.

                            I have always had a love of music. Although I stopped taking piano lessons many years ago, I still play a little bit by ear. I took AP Music Theory in 12th grade, sang a cappella all four years of college, and like to transcribe songs by ear. I have perfect pitch, which means I can name or reproduce any note without a reference, and I like to hum harmonies when I listen to songs. I enjoy many genres of music, from classical to pop to rock to a cappella, and even a bit of jazz and country. I created a Spotify playlist called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1iaroeBTY5Fs8dXtTBzgnX?si=XbF0v4ajRrmv_Up2a7EbTw" title="My spotify playlist">Circle of ♯s and ♭s</a>, where the end of one song and the start of the next song always have the same key signature. I've incorporated music into many aspects of my life, and it will always be a big part of who I am.

                        <p>
                            I recently rediscovered my interest in chess. After learning to play as a young kid, spending a semester in 6th grade playing it as an elective, and making several visits over my years of schooling to campus chess clubs, I have spent the last five months developing this hobby like never before. I started playing on chess.com, playing at least one, and often several, games every day since mid-April. I have improved my rapid rating from an elo of 1200 (the default when you create an account) to about 1500, putting me in the 96th percentile of players on the site. I also enjoy chess puzzles -- the LA Times' Sunday puzzle was a weekly pastime for me until it was discontinued, much to my chagrin. My interest in chess also inspired me to develop my C++ skills; I developed significant early experience with classes and threads by working on my <a href="https://github.com/spark2212/cpp-chess-program.git" title="Chess program GitHub repository">two-player chess program</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I have many other interests, like math, mythology, and astronomy. I love going to planetariums. I took advanced math classes years before my peers, and on my own time, I memorized 314 digits of pi for Pi Day. I am fascinated by mythology, and some of my favorite fiction books are based on ancient myths. I have many other interests, too many to go into detail here, but they all have had an impact on my life.
